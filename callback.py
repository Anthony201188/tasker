""" A callback method, also known simply as a callback, is a programming concept where a function (method) is passed as an argument to another function. The receiving function can then "call back" or invoke the passed function at a later time or in response to specific events or conditions.

In Python, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be treated like any other data type. This allows functions to be passed as arguments to other functions, making callbacks a powerful and flexible programming technique.

Callbacks are commonly used in various scenarios, including:

Event handling: In graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and web applications, callbacks are used to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks or mouse movements.

Asynchronous programming: In asynchronous programming paradigms, callbacks are used to handle results or actions when asynchronous tasks complete.

Customization and extensibility: Callbacks allow users of a library or framework to customize its behavior by providing their own functions to be executed at specific points.

Here's a simple example of a callback in Python: """

def perform_operation(x, y, callback):
    result = x + y
    callback(result) #this is the callback function

def print_result(value):
    print("Result:", value)

perform_operation(5, 10, print_result)
